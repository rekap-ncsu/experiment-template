# experiment-template
As researchers we often need to set up large scale experiments that need to process thousands of jobs. This repository provides helpful tips and scripts to set up such experiments.

There are two main folders inside this repository, which are: (1) `node/` and (2) `python/`. Each folder contains scripts to set up experiment in specific ecosystem/language (node and python). The scripts goal is almost identical, which is to help create queue of jobs, and help to process them. You can use either of them. More details about each set up can be found inside dedicated folder.
